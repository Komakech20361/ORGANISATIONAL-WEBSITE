        <p>Leopoldo Anywar secondary school is a community-owned and operating school in memory of Rev. Fr. Leopoldo Anywar who was one of the first Catholic priests from the Acholi <br>
            It is our hope to expand Leopoldo Anywar college to offer other courses apart from secondary education. LA College aims to provide a world-class education to exceptional students who possess strong leadership potential.
            Admission to the school is based on merit, and we provide scholarships to ensure access for students with demonstrated good academic performance. Pluralism is a core value and dimension of the educational program at the college, and we are proud that the student body of the College reflects our true population proportion, including both girls and boys who are adequately represented in various roles within the College.
            The College is an intellectually rigorous environment. The approach to teaching and learning is student-centered. This progressive approach emphasizes the development of critical thinking and creative problem-solving skills.
            We cater for students from senior one to senior four. A strong, nurturing residential program is available for secondary students fostering students’ self-discipline, personal responsibility, and leadership skills. Careful attention is paid to students’ academic achievement and to their physical, emotional, and spiritual development.
            We welcome you to visit us for one of our daily tours or come to one of our Open Days. We are proud of our outstanding facilities and would be pleased to share with you the excitement in learning that our students typically display. You will see the diversity of our curriculum and co-curricular life and be impressed by our beautiful campus which is located on Torit road in Palimu village.</p>
